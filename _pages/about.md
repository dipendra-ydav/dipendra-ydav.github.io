I am a software engineer in the DevOps team at [PlanetAI](https://planet-ai.de/) under the supervision of [Stefan Gerke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-gerke-672830157/). 

 Before that, I completed my Master at the [Universit√§t Rostock](https://www.uni-rostock.de/en/) in Rostock, Germany, department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ief.uni-rostock.de/en/). In my thesis, I explored ways of improving transfer learning with language Modeling for several classification tasks, most notably on emotion recognition, under the supervision of [Alex Potamianos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBQViyUAAAAJ&hl=en).
