I am a software engineer in the DevOps team at [PlanetAI](https://planet-ai.de/) under the supervision of [Stefan Gerke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-gerke-672830157/). I am mostly involved in building CI/CD pipelines and quality assurance of the [Intelligent Document Analysis](https://planet-ai.de/applications/document-analysis/) software.

 Before that, I completed my Master in the [Universität Rostock](https://www.uni-rostock.de/en/), Germany at the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ief.uni-rostock.de/en/). In [my thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NZTEU9Y5CaPQ5qVhFie5uAVm5-ZiN_LW/view?usp=sharing), I explored transfer learning for deep NLP systems on rarely annotated languages(Hindi and Nepali), under the supervision of [Kristina Yordanova](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=bU3bntoAAAAJ&hl=en) at the university and [Tobias Strauß](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=LacV_SQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at the PlanetAI.
